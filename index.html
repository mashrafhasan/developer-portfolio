            <h3>Reciter Al-QURAN and Singer Of HAMD-E RAB nashid Team</h3>
            <p>
                I am first and foremost a servant of God and a follower of the Prophet. Then a holder and servant of the
                Qur'an. Love people like blind. Although the path of love is not easy. Deception, betrayal, bad
                behavior,
                all these habits. Still love people. I love to read and recite the Qur'an. It can be said that this is
                my
                first and last hobby. I try to keep people happy by good manners, elegant behavior. I dream of being the
                perfect ideal person. At the same time, I dream of becoming a successful web developer, with which I can
                build a good position for myself with the service of Islam.</p>

            <h1>HUZIFA BIN UBAIDULLAH</h1>
            <h2>He is a Most cutest Kid</h2>
            <p>Huzaifa bin Ubaidullah. He is the only child of his parents. It is even a source of affection for two
                families. Insha Allah, when he grows up, he will raise the status of his parents and relatives. Everyone
                expects to be world class Hafez and Alem. I pray that he grows up as a child who cools the eyes of his
                parents.</p>
