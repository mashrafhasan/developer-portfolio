            <h3>Reciter Al-QURAN and Singer Of HAMD-E RAB nashid Team</h3>
            <p>
                I am first and foremost a servant of God and a follower of the Prophet. Then a holder and servant of the
                Qur'an. Love people like blind. Although the path of love is not easy. Deception, betrayal, bad
                behavior,
                all these habits. Still love people. I love to read and recite the Qur'an. It can be said that this is
                my
                first and last hobby. I try to keep people happy by good manners, elegant behavior. I dream of being the
                perfect ideal person. At the same time, I dream of becoming a successful web developer, with which I can
                build a good position for myself with the service of Islam.</p>
